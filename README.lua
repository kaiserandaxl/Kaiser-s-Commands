# Kaiser-s-Commands
My admin commands
Hello, this is version 1.0.0 of Kaiser's admin commands I'll teach you how to configure the commands to work for you, and do what you want.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default Owner, Administrator, and Moderator are enabled as commands, each command has a configured rank attached to it, you can change it.

You're also able to add customisable ranks if the ones aren't enough, just add a nubmer value to Ranks, and name the permissions accordingly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commands Owners can access by default: All

Commands Administrator can access by default: Ban, Restart, and all Moderator commands.

Commands Moderators can access by default: Strip, Slay, Slap, Setjob, Jail, Heal, Hp, Gotoland, God, Freeze, To, Bring, Return

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to configure Rank permissions:
In the value put the first rank that can access it (The number, not the name)

after you set it you will have to configure what ranks can access each command.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to configure Command Permissions:
Under the Permissions Folder you'll see the list of all the commands, in the value put the name of the rank you want to access it.

After this is configured the commands will detect the change, and automatically update.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jail Location:
You setup the jail location by setting the object value of Jail

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adminland: (Not required)
Do the same thing has the Jail object value

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You MUST set the group ID under ranks to the group you want it configured to! If this is not done your commands will not work.

All scripts are obfuscated, and do not cause harm. I will post a document with-in the pastebin to understand how to edit stuff better.

You must give your staff the commands list from the pastebin at the bottom of this.

Each command is lowercase.

Love From,
